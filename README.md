# DressageScoreSheet

DressageScoreSheet.sln is the console app.  I started my project here. 

This app is more of just a calculator app.  I hope to eventually include a database to store scores and horse competition numbers, names, and any other additional information on each horse.  

In real life, a judge will get a blank piece of paper with specific test printed on it.  The judge will write points in each movement.  At the end of the riding test, that paper will be given to a person who will calculate the points and announce the final score for that test.  I created a video before I made an API for the console app to show how it works.

Once I get the API done correctly, I will make another video.
